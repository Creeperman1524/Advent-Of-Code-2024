# Advent of Code 2024

A location to store all my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

This is the first year that I am seriously attempting the Advent of Code. Hoping for a complete 50 ⭐s!

## Structure

This year's project structure is as follows:

```
2024/
├── code/
│   ├── Day01/
│   │   ├── part1.py
│   │   └── part2.py
│   ├── Day02/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
├── notes/
│   ├── day01.md
│   ├── day02.md
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

## Solutions and Notes

Here is a table of contents detailing my solutions and notes about those solutions.

These contain insights and idea I had while completing each day!

> [!NOTE]
> These will contain the exact code I used when I submit my answers, which might not be pretty.
> I may add `Addendums` later for each part to clean up the code and make it more efficient

> These are timed off 5 averaged execution times for each part using the `grader.py` script
